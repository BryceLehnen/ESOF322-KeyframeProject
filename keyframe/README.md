# ESOF322-KeyframeProject

This project is meant to simulate how a user would be able to see an already parsed
video feed from their security system. In place of those, there are fake links that are meant
to show that it is working for the time being.
The only requirements for the input is that it be named as "monthdayyear" with no spaces (.txt is added)
and it needs to contain the following:
timestamp, video, audio, additional, devicetype, usershare
This information would be coming from another built in system that is seperate from this project.
